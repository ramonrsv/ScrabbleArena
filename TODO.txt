[1] Refactoring and rework of board, board_ui, game_controller, gameplay, and main_manager_ui are still pending.
Re-visit design decisions as many of the lower-level structures (tile_bag, etc.) have changed, offering better and
cleaner interfaces and functionality.

Approach these in the same manner, aiming for clean structures and interfaces. The hierarchy is approximately as below:
board -> board_ui / gameplay -> game_controller  -> main_manager_ui

- Find a convention for UI related sections of code, and define what UI related means.
- board probably requires only minor changes
- board_ui should get a more significant rework (gameplay should probably disappear altogether)

[] Add name parameter to configurations (will probably be used for UI purposes later on)
