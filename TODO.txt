[] Create a generalized controller, which internally has two ways for I/O, the GUI and CLI. At first it could be either
or, but eventually they should be able to work concurrently. The controller should also have an interface for AI to use.

By IO, input would be, for instance, to make a play, to move a tile from a tile tray to the board, etc. and output would
be to show the play on the board, or to output an ASCII board, etc. ALSO, it would include game configurations options,
like changing the game mode, changing the players (AI or human), stopping a game, starting a game, playing multiple ones.
-> This should probably be two different controllers, one for game operations (e.g. move tile, make play, etc.), and one
for game configurations (stop/start game, change mode, change players, etc.)

[] GUI has been refactored to lib/gui. The program should be able to operate independently of the GUI, which would be
optional and a second way to give input/output for plays and game state.

Qt should be encapsulated to make coding with it simpler and less error prone. It should also be fully contained within
/lib/gui and the GUI components (to the point that it doesn't have to be installed if the GUI isn't started).

[] Add name parameter to configurations (will probably be used for UI purposes later on)

Completed Tasks ________________________________________________________________________________________________________
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] Refactoring and rework of board, board_ui, game_controller, gameplay, and main_manager_ui are still pending.
Re-visit design decisions as many of the lower-level structures (tile_bag, etc.) have changed, offering better and
cleaner interfaces and functionality.

Approach these in the same manner, aiming for clean structures and interfaces. The hierarchy is approximately as below:
board -> board_ui / gameplay -> game_controller  -> main_manager_ui

- Find a convention for UI related sections of code, and define what UI related means.
- board probably requires only minor changes
- board_ui should get a more significant rework (gameplay should probably disappear altogether)

[] Refactoring and rework of dimension_and_coordinate, position, letter_value_map, tile_bag, game_type completed, along
with associated Unit Tests
